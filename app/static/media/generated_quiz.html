<html><body><pre>1. **Which of the following best describes the operation of single-solution based metaheuristics (S-metaheuristics)?**
    * (a) They maintain a population of solutions and evolve them over time.
    * (b) They iteratively improve a single solution by exploring its neighborhood.
    * (c) They construct a solution from scratch in each iteration.
    * (d) They use mathematical programming techniques to find optimal solutions.

    **Correct Answer:** (b)


2. **When dealing with very large neighborhoods in S-metaheuristics, which strategies are employed?**
    * (a)  Ignoring the neighborhood and randomly generating new solutions.
    * (b)  Using heuristic or exact search methods within the neighborhood.
    * (c)  Restricting the search to a small, randomly selected subset of the neighborhood.
    * (d)  Expanding the neighborhood further to encompass the entire search space.

    **Correct Answer:** (b)


3. **In the context of local search, what is the purpose of strategies like iterating from different initial solutions, accepting non-improving neighbors, and changing the neighborhood or objective function?**
    * (a) To speed up the convergence to a local optimum.
    * (b) To escape local optima and explore a wider range of the search space.
    * (c) To fine-tune the solution after reaching a local optimum.
    * (d) To reduce the computational complexity of the search process.

    **Correct Answer:** (b)


4. **Simulated Annealing (SA) uses a probabilistic acceptance criterion for neighbor solutions.  Which factor, besides the change in the objective function, influences this probability?**
    * (a) The size of the neighborhood.
    * (b) The current temperature.
    * (c) The length of the tabu list.
    * (d) The number of iterations performed.

    **Correct Answer:** (b)


5. **Which of the following is NOT a key component of Tabu Search (TS)?**
    * (a) Tabu list.
    * (b) Aspiration criteria.
    * (c) Cooling schedule.
    * (d) Diversification strategies.

    **Correct Answer:** (c)
