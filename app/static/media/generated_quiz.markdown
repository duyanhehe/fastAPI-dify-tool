1. **Which of the following is NOT a core concept of single-solution based metaheuristics (S-metaheuristics) as described in the document?**
    * (a) Neighborhoods
    * (b) Local Search
    * (c) Population Management
    * (d) Simulated Annealing

    **Correct Answer:** (c) Population Management


2. **The document discusses the trade-off between exploring large neighborhoods and smaller neighborhoods.  What is the primary advantage of exploring larger neighborhoods?**
    * (a) Reduced computational complexity
    * (b) Increased likelihood of finding better quality solutions
    * (c) Easier implementation
    * (d) Faster convergence to a local optimum

    **Correct Answer:** (b) Increased likelihood of finding better quality solutions


3. **Simulated Annealing (SA) uses a probabilistic approach to escape local optima. Which factor governs the probability of accepting a worse solution in SA?**
    * (a) The size of the neighborhood
    * (b) The cooling schedule and the difference between the current and new solution's objective function values
    * (c) The tabu list
    * (d) The aspiration criteria

    **Correct Answer:** (b) The cooling schedule and the difference between the current and new solution's objective function values


4. **Which of the following methods utilizes a "tabu list" to prevent revisiting recently explored solutions?**
    * (a) Simulated Annealing
    * (b) Threshold Accepting
    * (c) Tabu Search
    * (d) Great Deluge Algorithm

    **Correct Answer:** (c) Tabu Search


5. **What is the purpose of the aspiration criteria in Tabu Search?**
    * (a) To control the cooling schedule
    * (b) To diversify the search by exploring new regions of the search space
    * (c) To allow overriding the tabu list under certain conditions, such as when a tabu move leads to a significantly better solution
    * (d) To intensify the search by focusing on promising regions of the search space

    **Correct Answer:** (c) To allow overriding the tabu list under certain conditions, such as when a tabu move leads to a significantly better solution
